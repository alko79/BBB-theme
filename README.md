# BBB-theme
This is a basic blog theme using the blog plugin by rainlab. 
I used the Materialize js to get the material look and feel.
After used it on my site I decided to share this base so others can use it as a start for their own sites.
I provided also example logo,banner and background png images.

Javascripts:
   -Jquery.js
   -Materialize.js (good guys)
Font and icons:
   -Google font: Work
   -Fontawesome
Comments plugin:
   -Disqus
